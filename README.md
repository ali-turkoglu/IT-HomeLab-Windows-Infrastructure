# Windows Infrastructure HomeLab

> **Part 1 of the IT-HomeLab Series**
>
> This repository documents how I built a complete Windows infrastructure in my HomeLab from scratch. Every phase is documented step by step, from the first hardware purchase to a fully working Windows environment.

> [!TIP]
> **New to this repository?**
>
> I recommend reading the documentation from beginning to end. Each phase builds on the previous one, making it easier to understand how the entire environment was planned, built, and configured.

# Project Overview

This repository is the first project in my IT-HomeLab Series.

The goal of this project was to build a realistic Windows infrastructure in a HomeLab using modern Microsoft technologies. Instead of showing only the final result, I documented every important step along the way, including planning, installation, configuration, troubleshooting, and lessons learned.

The environment was built from scratch using Proxmox VE and Windows Server. During the project, I configured Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, File Services, Print Services, Backup solutions, and WSUS by following common practices used in many organizations.

This repository is both a learning project and a technical portfolio. I hope it can also help anyone who wants to build a similar HomeLab or learn Windows system administration.

- Learn and apply common best practices used in Windows administration.
- Document every important step, decision, problem, and solution.
- Document what I learned so others can build a similar HomeLab.
- Build a GitHub portfolio that shows my practical experience.

# Hardware

The HomeLab is built using affordable and energy-efficient hardware that provides a good balance between performance, power consumption, and cost.

The complete hardware selection process, purchasing decisions, and acceptance testing are documented in detail.

➡️ **[Phase 1 – Hardware Selection & Procurement](docs/1-Hardware/README.md)**

# Architecture

This repository focuses on the Windows infrastructure running inside my HomeLab.

The environment includes:

- Physical HomeLab hardware
- Proxmox VE virtualization
- Windows Server
- Active Directory
- DNS & DHCP
- Group Policy
- File Server
- Print Server
- Backup solutions
- WSUS

The architecture diagrams will be updated as the documentation continues to grow.

## IT-HomeLab Series

This repository is the first project in my IT-HomeLab Series.

Each repository focuses on a different area of modern IT while staying connected as part of the same HomeLab.

| Status | Repository |
|--------|------------|
| ✅ | **IT-HomeLab-Windows-Infrastructure** *(Current Repository)* |
| ✅ | [**IT-HomeLab-Cloud-Identity**](https://github.com/ali-turkoglu/IT-HomeLab-Cloud-Identity) |
| 🚧 | [**IT-HomeLab-Linux-Containers**](https://github.com/ali-turkoglu/IT-HomeLab-Linux-Administration) |
| ⏳ | **IT-HomeLab-Network-Security** |
| ⏳ | **IT-HomeLab-Service-Management** |

The series will continue as I build, learn, and document more technologies in my HomeLab.
